To create and save notes, go to the deployed Heroku site, click the "Get Started" button, type a title in the "Note Title" field and a message in the "Note Text" field and click the save icon in the top-right corner.  The save icon will not appear if either the "Note Title" or "Note Text" fields are empty.  To view previously saved notes, click a note title on the left sidebar of the application.  To delete a previously saved note, click the trash icon near the note title on the left sidebar.
